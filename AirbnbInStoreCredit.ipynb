        "How would we go about understanding if an in-store credit payment refund option is beneficial to the abnb platform?\n",
        "The proposed solution was pretty unclear and ambiguous.\n",
        "It was something  along the lines of modeling $y$ = \"some kind of revenue dollar value\" given a set of features, then testing to see if $y$ increased when we added a feature representing the new in-store payment option (categorical).\n",
        "I realized somethings were patently wrong with the proposed solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Proxy model approach\n",
        "- $y$ = \"revenue dollar value\" is too ambiguous. When I think about what the label of training data points would look like, revenue doesn't make as much sense.\n",
        "I think we would have to narrow it down to something like \"revenue generated by customer $x$ in $m$ day period\"\n",
        "- It might be better to use some kind of proxy metric to revenue.\n",
        "For instance, my initial suggestion was let $y$ be the probability of a user using the in-store credit or not.\n",
        "But that doesn't make sense becuase we need to be able to compare the two groups, with the new feature and without the new feature.\n",
        "If user's don't have the in-store credit option, modeling $y$ in this way doesn't make sense.\n",
        "- Perhaps, $y$ = \"probability of a user rebooking\" is a better proxy.\n",
        "- What if a user doesn't rebook but still uses the credit eventually. Did the credit encourage the customer to return?\n",
        "- How do we use a proxy measure that? We can't measure if the user spent the credit directly.\n",
        "- $y$ = \"probability of user spending at least the original amount of money in $m$ days after cancellation\"\n",
        "- What is \"rebooking\"? Is it booking again within a certain time window? Is it spending the credit that was given? Perhaps, we can generally define rebooking as a guest spending at least the same amount of money as a canceled booking within a certain period of time from the cancellation.\n",
        "- In a typical randomized controlled trial (RCT) scenario, say with testing medication. We assume users in group A and group B will both take the medication. In our case, treatment is giving the user an option to receive in-store credit, but the user might not necessarily choose this option. Do we remove all users that didn't choose the option? This reminds me of simulating a bandit offline using historical data. We only take as a reward the rows where the user actually selected the arm they were shown.\n",
